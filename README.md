# Local Wiki

I just started this project to simply experiment with some Golang code. It's a basic web app that creates text files to store information. You have the ability to edit and create even more!

## Writing Web Applications

For create this App I follow the documentation of Golang https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/

## How to run the Web App

1. Install Golang by following the instructions in this link: https://go.dev/doc/install
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder.
4. Build the program by running the command `go build wiki.go` in the terminal.
5. Finally, execute the program by running the command `./wiki.exe` in the terminal.
